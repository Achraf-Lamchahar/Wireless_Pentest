Introduction:
“This repository contains a summary based on ‘Backtrack 5 Wireless Penetration Testing Beginner’s Guide: Master Bleeding Edge Wireless Testing Techniques With Backtrack 5’. 
The commands have been updated from Backtrack to the latest Kali Linux versions.”
Purpose:
“This book is an invaluable resource for understanding the wireless environment, a topic that doesn’t have as many resources as other pentesting areas. 
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to wireless penetration testing.”
Post-Exploitation:
“A post-exploitation section will be added to demonstrate the potential harm caused by weak WiFi passwords. 
This will help change the perception that a WiFi network is just a ‘WiFi’; it is a network susceptible to various attacks, 
from eavesdropping to session hijacking and account takeover.”
Call to Action:
“Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute or raise issues as those are just my personal notes that I took when preparing for the OSWP and decided to share them. Let’s make wireless networks more secure together!”
